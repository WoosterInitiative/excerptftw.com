We had a personal need for a repository of credible responses to false information on social media. It was too much work to come up with something every time it was needed. Not only does this supply a great list of those resources, but we've worked to make it as easy as possible to copy that content for sharing in a comment or post.

We hope you find it as useful as we do.
